242 lender.
243 (b) <b>WALK-THROUGH INSPECTION/RE-INSPECTION:</b> On the day prior to Closing Date, or on Closing Date prior to
244 time of Closing, as specified by Buyer, Buyer or Buyer’s representative may perform a walk-through (and follow-up

253 obligation to cooperate shall include Seller’s execution of necessary authorizations, consents, or other documents
254 necessary for Buyer to conduct inspections and have estimates of such repairs or work prepared, but in fulfilling
255 such obligation, Seller shall not be required to expend, or become obligated to expend, any money.

260 other items is authorized, and agrees by acceptance of them, to deposit them promptly, hold same in escrow within the
261 State of Florida and, subject to COLLECTION, disburse them in accordance with terms and conditions of this Contract.
262 Failure of funds to become COLLECTED shall not excuse Buyer’s performance. When conflicting demands for the
263 Deposit are received, or Agent has a good faith doubt as to entitlement to the Deposit, Agent may take such actions
264 permitted by this Paragraph 13, as Agent deems advisable. If in doubt as to Agent’s duties or liabilities under this
265 Contract, Agent may, at Agent’s option, continue to hold the subject matter of the escrow until the parties agree to its
266 disbursement or until a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine the rights of the parties, or
267 Agent may deposit same with the clerk of the circuit court having jurisdiction of the dispute. An attorney who represents
268 a party and also acts as Agent may represent such party in such action. Upon notifying all parties concerned of such
269 action, all liability on the part of Agent shall fully terminate, except to the extent of accounting for any items previously
270 delivered out of escrow. If a licensed real estate broker, Agent will comply with provisions of Chapter 475, F.S., as
271 amended and FREC rules to timely resolve escrow disputes through mediation, arbitration, interpleader or an escrow
272 disbursement order.
273 Any proceeding between Buyer and Seller wherein Agent is made a party because of acting as Agent hereunder, or in
274 any proceeding where Agent interpleads the subject matter of the escrow, Agent shall recover reasonable attorney’s
275 fees and costs incurred, to be paid pursuant to court order out of the escrowed funds or equivalent. Agent shall not be
276 liable to any party or person for mis-delivery of any escrowed items, unless such mis-delivery is due to Agent’s willful
277 breach of this Contract or Agent’s gross negligence. This Paragraph 13 shall survive Closing or termination of this
278 Contract.
279 14. <b>PROFESSIONAL ADVICE; BROKER LIABILITY:</b> Broker advises Buyer and Seller to verify Property condition, square
280 footage, and all other facts and representations made pursuant to this Contract and to consult appropriate professionals
281 for legal, tax, environmental, and other specialized advice concerning matters affecting the Property and the transaction
282 contemplated by this Contract. Broker represents to Buyer that Broker does not reside on the Property and that all
283 representations (oral, written or otherwise) by Broker are based on Seller representations or public records. BUYER
284 <b>AGREES TO RELY SOLELY ON SELLER, PROFESSIONAL INSPECTORS AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES
285 FOR VERIFICATION OF PROPERTY CONDITION, SQUARE FOOTAGE AND FACTS THAT MATERIALLY AFFECT
286 PROPERTY VALUE AND NOT ON THE REPRESENTATIONS (ORAL, WRITTEN OR OTHERWISE) OF BROKER. </b>

345 assumed mortgages and purchase money mortgages, if any (if additional items, attach addendum); provided, that, none
346 prevent use of Property for <b>RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES.</b> If there exists at Closing any violation of items identified in (b)
347 – (f) above, then the same shall be deemed a title defect. Marketable title shall be determined according to applicable
348 Title Standards adopted by authority of The Florida Bar and in accordance with law.
349 (ii) <b>TITLE EXAMINATION:</b> Buyer shall have 5 days after receipt of Title Commitment to examine it and notify Seller in
350 writing specifying defect(s), if any, that render title unmarketable. If Seller provides Title Commitment and it is delivered
351 to Buyer less than 5 days prior to Closing Date, Buyer may extend Closing for up to 5 days after date of receipt to
352 examine same in accordance with this STANDARD A. Seller shall have 30 days (“Cure Period”) after receipt of Buyer’s
353 notice to take reasonable diligent efforts to remove defects. If Buyer fails to so notify Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to
354 have accepted title as it then is. If Seller cures defects within Cure Period, Seller will deliver written notice to Buyer (with
355 proof of cure acceptable to Buyer and Buyer’s attorney) and the parties will close this Contract on Closing Date (or if
356 Closing Date has passed, within 10 days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s notice). If Seller is unable to cure defects
357 within Cure Period, then Buyer may, within 5 days after expiration of Cure Period, deliver written notice to Seller: (a)
358 extending Cure Period for a specified period not to exceed 120 days within which Seller shall continue to use
359 reasonable diligent effort to remove or cure the defects (“Extended Cure Period”); or (b) electing to accept title with
360 existing defects and close this Contract on Closing Date (or if Closing Date has passed, within the earlier of 10 days
361 after end of Extended Cure Period or Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s notice), or (c) electing to terminate this Contract and
362 receive a refund of the Deposit, thereby releasing Buyer and Seller from all further obligations under this Contract. If
363 after reasonable diligent effort, Seller is unable to timely cure defects, and Buyer does not waive the defects, this
364 Contract shall terminate, and Buyer shall receive a refund of the Deposit, thereby releasing Buyer and Seller from all
365 further obligations under this Contract.
366 <b>B. SURVEY:</b> If Survey discloses encroachments on the Real Property or that improvements located thereon encroach
367 on setback lines, easements, or lands of others, or violate any restrictions, covenants, or applicable governmental
368 regulations described in STANDARD A (i)(a), (b) or (d) above, Buyer shall deliver written notice of such matters,
369 together with a copy of Survey, to Seller within 5 days after Buyer’s receipt of Survey, but no later than Closing. If Buyer
370 timely delivers such notice and Survey to Seller, such matters identified in the notice and Survey shall constitute a title
371 defect, subject to cure obligations of STANDARD A above. If Seller has delivered a prior survey, Seller shall, at Buyer’s
372 request, execute an affidavit of “no change” to the Real Property since the preparation of such prior survey, to the
373 extent the affirmations therein are true and correct.
374 <b>C. INGRESS AND EGRESS:</b> Seller represents that there is ingress and egress to the Real Property and title to the
375 Real Property is insurable in accordance with STANDARD A without exception for lack of legal right of access.
376 <b>D. LEASE INFORMATION:</b> Seller shall, at least 10 days prior to Closing, furnish to Buyer estoppel letters from
377 tenant(s)/occupant(s) specifying nature and duration of occupancy, rental rates, advanced rent and security deposits
378 paid by tenant(s) or occupant(s)(“Estoppel Letter(s)”). If Seller is unable to obtain such Estoppel Letter(s) the same
379 information shall be furnished by Seller to Buyer within that time period in the form of a Seller’s affidavit and Buyer may
380 thereafter contact tenant(s) or occupant(s) to confirm such information. If Estoppel Letter(s) or Seller’s affidavit, if any,
381 differ materially from Seller’s representations and lease(s) provided pursuant to Paragraph 6, or if tenant(s)/occupant(s)
382 fail or refuse to confirm Seller’s affidavit, Buyer may deliver written notice to Seller within 5 days after receipt of such
383 information, but no later than 5 days prior to Closing Date, terminating this Contract and receive a refund of the Deposit,
384 thereby releasing Buyer and Seller from all further obligations under this Contract. Seller shall, at Closing, deliver and
385 assign all leases to Buyer who shall assume Seller’s obligations thereunder.
386 <b>E. LIENS:</b> Seller shall furnish to Buyer at Closing an affidavit attesting (i) to the absence of any financing statement,
387 claims of lien or potential lienors known to Seller and (ii) that there have been no improvements or repairs to the Real
388 Property for 90 days immediately preceding Closing Date. If the Real Property has been improved or repaired within
389 that time, Seller shall deliver releases or waivers of construction liens executed by all general contractors,
390 subcontractors, suppliers and materialmen in addition to Seller’s lien affidavit setting forth names of all such general
391 contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and materialmen, further affirming that all charges for improvements or repairs
392 which could serve as a basis for a construction lien or a claim for damages have been paid or will be paid at Closing.
393 <b>F. TIME:</b> Calendar days shall be used in computing time periods. Time is of the essence in this Contract.
394 Other than time for acceptance and Effective Date as set forth in Paragraph 3, any time periods provided for or dates
395 specified in this Contract, whether preprinted, handwritten, typewritten or inserted herein, which shall end or occur on a
396 Saturday, Sunday, or a national legal holiday (see 5 U.S.C. 6103) shall extend to 5:00 p.m. (where the Property is
397 located) of the next business day.
398 <b>G. FORCE MAJEURE:</b> Buyer or Seller shall not be required to perform any obligation under this Contract or be liable
399 to each other for damages so long as performance or non-performance of the obligation is delayed, caused or
400 prevented by Force Majeure. “Force Majeure” means: hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fire, acts of God, unusual
401 transportation delays, wars, insurrections, acts of terrorism, and any other cause not reasonably within control of Buyer
402 or Seller, and which, by: exercise of reasonable diligent effort, the non-performing party is unable in whole or in part to
403 prevent or overcome. All time periods, including Closing Date, will be extended for the period that the Force Majeure
404 prevents performance under this Contract, provided, however, if such Force Majeure continues to prevent performance

405 under this Contract more than 14 days beyond Closing Date, then either party may terminate this Contract by delivering
406 written notice to the other and the Deposit shall be refunded to Buyer, thereby releasing Buyer and Seller from all
407 further obligations under this Contract.
408 <b>H. CONVEYANCE:</b> Seller shall convey marketable title to the Real Property by statutory warranty, trustee’s, personal
409 representative’s, or guardian’s deed, as appropriate to the status of Seller, subject only to matters described in
410 STANDARD A and those accepted by Buyer. Personal Property shall, at request of Buyer, be transferred by absolute
411 bill of sale with warranty of title, subject only to such matters as may be provided for in this Contract.
412 <b>I. CLOSING LOCATION; DOCUMENTS; AND PROCEDURE:</b>
413 (i) <b>LOCATION:</b> Closing will take place in the county where the Real Property is located at the office of the attorney or
414 other closing agent (“Closing Agent”) designated by the party paying for the owner’s policy of title insurance, or, if no
415 title insurance, designated by Seller. Closing may be conducted by mail or electronic means.
416 (ii) <b>CLOSING DOCUMENTS:</b> Seller shall at or prior to Closing, execute and deliver, as applicable, deed, bill of sale,
417 certificate(s) of title or other documents necessary to transfer title to the Property, construction lien affidavit(s), owner’s
418 possession and no lien affidavit(s), and assignment(s) of leases. Seller shall provide Buyer with paid receipts for all
419 work done on the Property pursuant to this Contract. Buyer shall furnish and pay for, as applicable the survey, flood
420 elevation certification, and documents required by Buyer’s lender.
421 (iii) <b>PROCEDURE:</b> The deed shall be recorded upon <b>COLLECTION </b>of all closing funds. If the Title Commitment
422 provides insurance against adverse matters pursuant to Section 627.7841, F.S., as amended, the escrow closing
423 procedure required by STANDARD J shall be waived, and Closing Agent shall, <b>subject to COLLECTION of all closing
424 funds</b>, disburse at Closing the brokerage fees to Broker and the net sale proceeds to Seller.
425 <b>J. ESCROW CLOSING PROCEDURE:</b> If Title Commitment issued pursuant to Paragraph 9(c) does not provide for
426 insurance against adverse matters as permitted under Section 627.7841, F.S., as amended, the following escrow and
427 closing procedures shall apply: (1) all Closing proceeds shall be held in escrow by the Closing Agent for a period of not
428 more than 10 days after Closing; (2) if Seller’s title is rendered unmarketable, through no fault of Buyer, Buyer shall,
429 within the 10 day period, notify Seller in writing of the defect and Seller shall have 30 days from date of receipt of such
430 notification to cure the defect; (3) if Seller fails to timely cure the defect, the Deposit and all Closing funds paid by Buyer
431 shall, within 5 days after written demand by Buyer, be refunded to Buyer and, simultaneously with such repayment,
432 Buyer shall return the Personal Property, vacate the Real Property and re-convey the Property to Seller by special
433 warranty deed and bill of sale; and (4) if Buyer fails to make timely demand for refund of the Deposit, Buyer shall take
434 title as is, waiving all rights against Seller as to any intervening defect except as may be available to Buyer by virtue of
435 warranties contained in the deed or bill of sale.
436 <b>K. PRORATIONS; CREDITS:</b> The following recurring items will be made current (if applicable) and prorated as of the
437 day prior to Closing Date, or date of occupancy if occupancy occurs before Closing Date: real estate taxes (including
438 special benefit tax assessments imposed by a CDD), interest, bonds, association fees, insurance, rents and other
439 expenses of Property. Buyer shall have option of taking over existing policies of insurance, if assumable, in which event
440 premiums shall be prorated. Cash at Closing shall be increased or decreased as may be required by prorations to be
441 made through day prior to Closing. Advance rent and security deposits, if any, will be credited to Buyer. Escrow
442 deposits held by Seller’s mortgagee will be paid to Seller. Taxes shall be prorated based on current year’s tax with due
443 allowance made for maximum allowable discount, homestead and other exemptions. If Closing occurs on a date when
444 current year’s millage is not fixed but current year’s assessment is available, taxes will be prorated based upon such
445 assessment and prior year’s millage. If current year’s assessment is not available, then taxes will be prorated on prior
446 year’s tax. If there are completed improvements on the Real Property by January 1st of year of Closing, which
improvements were not in existence on January 1st 447 of prior year, then taxes shall be prorated based upon prior year’s
448 millage and at an equitable assessment to be agreed upon between the parties, failing which, request shall be made to
449 the County Property Appraiser for an informal assessment taking into account available exemptions. A tax proration
450 based on an estimate shall, at either party’s request, be readjusted upon receipt of current year’s tax bill. This
451 STANDARD K shall survive Closing.
452 <b>L. ACCESS TO PROPERTY TO CONDUCT APPRAISALS, INSPECTIONS, AND WALK-THROUGH:</b> Seller shall,
453 upon reasonable notice, provide utilities service and access to Property for appraisals and inspections, including a walk454 through (or follow-up walk-through if necessary) prior to Closing.
455 <b>M. RISK OF LOSS:</b> If, after Effective Date, but before Closing, Property is damaged by fire or other casualty
456 (“Casualty Loss”) and cost of restoration (which shall include cost of pruning or removing damaged trees) does not
457 exceed 1.5% of Purchase Price, cost of restoration shall be an obligation of Seller and Closing shall proceed pursuant
458 to terms of this Contract. If restoration is not completed as of Closing, a sum equal to 125% of estimated cost to
459 complete restoration (not to exceed 1.5% of Purchase Price), will be escrowed at Closing. If actual cost of restoration
460 exceeds escrowed amount, Seller shall pay such actual costs (but, not in excess of 1.5% of Purchase Price). Any
461 unused portion of escrowed amount shall be returned to Seller. If cost of restoration exceeds 1.5% of Purchase Price,
462 Buyer shall elect to either take Property “as is” together with the 1.5%, or receive a refund of the Deposit, thereby
463 releasing Buyer and Seller from all further obligations under this Contract. Seller’s sole obligation with respect to tree
464 damage by casualty or other natural occurrence shall be cost of pruning or removal.

493 upon which the lender is willing to make a particular mortgage loan to a particular borrower. Neither a pre-approval
494 letter nor a prequalification letter shall be deemed a Loan Commitment for purposes of this Contract.
495 <b>U. APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE:</b> This Contract shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
496 Florida and venue for resolution of all disputes, whether by mediation, arbitration or litigation, shall lie in the county

498 <b>V. FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT (“FIRPTA”):</b> If a seller of U.S. real property is a “foreign
499 person” as defined by FIRPTA, Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the buyer of the real property to
500 withhold 10% of the amount realized by the seller on the transfer and remit the withheld amount to the Internal Revenue
501 Service (IRS) unless an exemption to the required withholding applies or the seller has obtained a Withholding
502 Certificate from the IRS authorizing a reduced amount of withholding. Due to the complexity and potential risks of
503 FIRPTA, Buyer and Seller should seek legal and tax advice regarding compliance, particularly if an “exemption” is
504 claimed on the sale of residential property for $300,000 or less.
505 (i) No withholding is required under Section 1445 if the Seller is not a “foreign person,” provided Buyer accepts proof
506 of same from Seller, which may include Buyer’s receipt of certification of non-foreign status from Seller, signed under
507 penalties of perjury, stating that Seller is not a foreign person and containing Seller’s name, U.S. taxpayer identification
508 number and home address (or office address, in the case of an entity), as provided for in 26 CFR 1.1445-2(b).
509 Otherwise, Buyer shall withhold 10% of the amount realized by Seller on the transfer and timely remit said funds to the
510 IRS.
511 (ii) If Seller has received a Withholding Certificate from the IRS which provides for reduced or eliminated withholding in
512 this transaction and provides same to Buyer by Closing, then Buyer shall withhold the reduced sum, if any required, and
513 timely remit said funds to the IRS.
514 (iii) If prior to Closing Seller has submitted a completed application to the IRS for a Withholding Certificate and has
515 provided to Buyer the notice required by 26 CFR 1.1445-1(c) (2)(i)(B) but no Withholding Certificate has been received
516 as of Closing, Buyer shall, at Closing, withhold 10% of the amount realized by Seller on the transfer and, at Buyer’s
517 option, either (a) timely remit the withheld funds to the IRS or (b) place the funds in escrow, at Seller’s expense, with an
518 escrow agent selected by Buyer and pursuant to terms negotiated by the parties, to be subsequently disbursed in
519 accordance with the Withholding Certificate issued by the IRS or remitted directly to the IRS if the Seller’s application is
520 rejected or upon terms set forth in the escrow agreement.
521 (iv) In the event the net proceeds due Seller are not sufficient to meet the withholding requirement(s) in this transaction,
522 Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at Closing, the additional COLLECTED funds necessary to satisfy the applicable
523 requirement and thereafter Buyer shall timely remit said funds to the IRS or escrow the funds for disbursement in
524 accordance with the final determination of the IRS, as applicable.

REO # _____________________________
<center><h3>REAL ESTATE PURCHASE ADDENDUM<h3></center>
This Real Estate Purchase Addendum (“Addendum”) is to be made part of, and incorporated into, the Real Estate Purchase Contract (the
"Contract"), between ______________________________________________________________________________ ("Seller") and
____________________________________________________________________________ ("Purchaser") for the property and
improvements located at the following address: ____________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________( "Property").
As used in this Addendum, the Contract, Addendum and any riders thereto shall be collectively referred to as the “Agreement”.
The Seller and the Purchaser agree as follows:
1. Offer:
(a) Acknowledgement of Sufficient Offer: The Purchaser has offered to purchase the property for a purchase price in the
amount of $____________ in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (“Offer”). The Seller has reviewed the
Offer and deemed it sufficient for acceptance.
(b) Acceptance of Offer: Notwithstanding Seller’s acknowledgement that the Offer is sufficient for acceptance, the Purchaser
agrees that the Agreement remains subject to acceptance by the Seller and must be signed by all parties in order to be
binding. The Agreement shall be effective as of the date of execution by Seller (“Effective Date”). The Purchaser's earnest
money deposit of $_____________________________ is to be placed in a trust account acceptable to the Seller within two
(2) calendar days following the Effective Date. The Agreement, signed by the Purchaser and reflecting the terms as
acknowledged by the Seller, must be received by the Seller within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice that the
Offer was sufficient for acceptance. If the Seller does not receive the signed Agreement by such date, the Purchaser’s offer
shall be deemed null and void. As used in this paragraph, the term "received by the Seller" means actual receipt of the
Agreement by the Seller's listing agent.
The Purchaser shall present proof, satisfactory to the Seller, of the Purchaser’s funds or prequalification for a mortgage loan in
an amount and under terms sufficient for the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The prequalification
shall include but is not limited to, a certification of prequalification or a mortgage loan commitment from a mortgage lender, a
satisfactory credit report and/or proof of funds sufficient to meet the Purchaser’s obligations under the Agreement. The
Purchaser’s submission of proof of prequalification is a condition precedent to the Seller’s acceptance. The Seller may require
the Purchaser to obtain, at no cost to the Purchaser, loan prequalification from a Seller approved third party lender.
Notwithstanding any Seller required prequalification, the Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser is free to obtain financing from
any source.
2. Time is of the Essence: Settlement Date:
(a) It is agreed that time is of the essence with respect to all dates specified in the Agreement. This means that all
deadlines are intended to be strict and absolute.
(b) The closing shall take place on a date (“Settlement Date”) on or before __________________________________
(“Expiration Date”), unless extended in writing signed by the Seller and the Purchaser or extended by the Seller under
the terms of the Agreement. The closing shall be held at a place so designated and approved by the Seller unless
otherwise required by applicable law. The Purchaser has the right to make an independent selection of their own
attorney, settlement company, escrow company, title company and/or title insurance company in connection with the
closing. The date the closing takes place shall be referred to as the Settlement Date for purposes of the Agreement. If
the closing does not occur by the Expiration Date, or in any extension, the Agreement is automatically terminated and
the Seller may retain any earnest money deposit as liquidated damages.
</pre>







<pre>
Financing: This Agreement (check one):
( ) is cash
( ) is ( ) is not, contingent on the Purchaser obtaining financing for the purchase of the Property. If this
Agreement is contingent on financing, the type of financing shall be the following (check one):
___ Conventional
___ FHA
___ VA
___ Other (specify: _______________________________________)
All Financing.
If this Agreement is contingent on financing, the Purchaser shall apply for a loan in the amount of
$____________________________ with a term of __________ years, at prevailing rates, terms and conditions. The
Purchaser shall complete and submit to a mortgage lender, of the Purchaser’s choice, an application for a mortgage loan
containing the terms set forth in this paragraph within five (5) calendar days of the Effective Date, and shall use diligent
efforts to obtain a mortgage loan commitment by ____________________________________. If, despite the
Purchaser’s diligent efforts, the Purchaser cannot obtain a mortgage loan commitment by the specified date, then either
the Purchaser or the Seller may terminate the Agreement by giving written notice to the other party. The Purchaser’s
notice must include a copy of the loan application, proof of the application date, and a copy of the denial letter from the

Purchaser.

lender, after negotiations have been completed may, at Seller’s discretion, require renegotiation of all terms of the

inspection and any objections to the condition of the Property and to have accepted the Property. The Purchaser shall keep

calendar days from the Effective Date, whichever first occurs, the Purchaser will provide written notice to the Seller of any
items disapproved. The Purchaser’s silence shall be deemed as acceptance of the condition of the Property. The Purchaser

Purchaser’s disapproval of the condition of the property is based. In no event shall the Seller be obligated to make any repairs

inspection the Purchaser is not satisfied with repairs or treatments, Purchaser may terminate the Agreement at any time prior
to closing.
In situations that are applicable, a structural, electrical, mechanical, environmental or termite inspection report may have been
prepared for the benefit of the Seller. Upon request, the Purchaser will be allowed to review the report to obtain the same
information and knowledge the Seller has about the condition of the Property but the Purchaser acknowledges that the
inspection reports were prepared for the sole use and benefit of the Seller. The Purchaser will not rely upon any such
inspection reports obtained by the Seller in making a decision to purchase the Property.
(b) If the Property is a condominium or planned unit development or co-operative, unless otherwise required by law, the
Purchaser, at the Purchaser’s own expense, is responsible for obtaining and reviewing the covenants, conditions and
restrictions and bylaws of the condominium, or planned unit development or cooperative (“Governing Documents”) within
ten (10) calendar days of the Effective Date. The Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts, as determined in the Seller’s sole
discretion, to assist the Purchaser in obtaining a copy of the Governing Documents. The Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted the Governing Documents if the Purchaser does not provide the Seller notice in writing, within fifteen (15)
calendar days of the Effective Date, of the Purchaser’s disapproval of the Governing Documents. In the event Purchaser
disapproves of the Governing Documents, Purchaser has the right to terminate the Agreement provided the Purchaser
notifies Seller in writing of Purchaser’s disapproval within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Effective Date.
6. Repairs: All repairs and treatments will be completed by a vendor approved by the Seller, and will be subject to the Seller's
satisfaction only. If the Seller has agreed to pay for treatment of wood infesting organisms, the Seller shall treat only active
infestation. Neither the Purchaser, nor its representatives, shall enter upon the Property to make any repairs and/or
treatments prior to closing. The Purchaser shall inspect the repairs and/or treatments as set forth in paragraph 5(a) or is
deemed to have waived such inspection and any objections to the repairs and/or treatments. The Purchaser acknowledges
that all repairs and treatments are done for the benefit of the Seller and not for the benefit of the Purchaser and that the
Purchaser has inspected or has been given the opportunity to inspect repairs and treatments. Any repairs or treatments made
or caused to be made by the Seller shall be completed prior to closing. Under no circumstances shall the Seller be required to
make any repairs or treatments after the Settlement Date. The Purchaser acknowledges that closing on this transaction
shall be deemed the Purchaser’s reaffirmation that the Purchaser is satisfied with the condition of the Property and with
all repairs and treatments to the Property and waives all claims related to such condition and to the quality of the repairs
or treatments to the Property. Any repairs or treatments shall be performed for functional purposes only and exact
restoration of appearance or cosmetic items following any repairs or treatments shall not be required. The Seller shall not be
obligated to obtain or provide to the Purchaser any receipts for repairs, or treatments, written statements indicating dates or
types of repairs and/ or treatments or copies of such receipts or statements nor any other documentation regarding any repairs

15. Defects in Title: If the Purchaser raises an objection to the Seller’s title to the Property, which, if valid, would make title to
the Property uninsurable, the Seller shall have the right unilaterally to terminate the Agreement by giving written notice of
the termination to the Purchaser. However, if the Seller is able to correct the problem through reasonable efforts, as the
Seller determines, at its sole and absolute discretion, prior to the Expiration Date, including any written extensions, or if title
insurance is available from a reputable title insurance company at regular rates containing affirmative coverage for the title
objections, then the Agreement shall remain in full force and the Purchaser shall perform pursuant to the terms set in the
Agreement. The Seller is not obligated to remove any exception or to bring any action or proceeding or bear any expense in
order to convey title to the Property or to make the title marketable and/or insurable but any attempt by the Seller to remove
such title exceptions shall not impose an obligation upon the Seller to remove those exceptions. The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Seller’s title to the Property may be subject to court approval of foreclosure or to mortgagor’s right of redemption. In
the event the Seller is not able to (a) make the title insurable or correct any problem or (b) obtain title insurance from a
reputable title insurance company, all as provided herein, the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement and any earnest money
deposit will be returned to the Purchaser as the Purchaser’s sole remedy at law or equity. If the Purchaser elects to take title
subject to the title objections, the Purchaser shall so notify the Seller. The Purchaser’s silence as to any title objections shall
be deemed as acceptance.
